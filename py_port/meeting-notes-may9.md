# MazeBuilder Python Port - Meeting Notes (May 9, 2024)

## Attendees
- Norrisa (Project Lead/Product Owner)
- Claude (Developer)
- Chen (UI/UX Specialist)

## Agenda
1. Review Sprint 1 completion status
2. Discuss priorities for Sprint 2
3. Plan next steps for the Python port

## Discussion Summary

### Sprint 1 Review
Claude presented the completed console implementation with the Binary Tree algorithm:
- Cell and Grid classes are implemented with proper bit flag directions
- Command-line interface works with size customization
- Path finding with Dijkstra's algorithm implemented
- Colored output and distance markers are working
- Testing framework is in place

All agreed that Sprint 1 acceptance criteria have been met and the basic console app is functional.

### UI Enhancement Proposals
Chen suggested several UI improvements before moving on to other algorithms:

1. **Color customization:** Add `--path-color` and `--distance-color` options
2. **Wall styling:** Implement Unicode box drawing characters for cleaner walls
3. **Cell content alignment:** Improve spacing for multi-digit distances
4. **Legend/Key:** Add explanatory text below the maze display
5. **Terminal size awareness:** Detect terminal size and adjust output

Chen emphasized: "The console experience is our foundation. Polishing it now will improve user experience immediately and inform our Streamlit UI later."

Claude noted that these were valuable enhancements but suggested completing the core algorithm implementations first: "Having all the maze algorithms ported would give us a complete functional implementation before focusing on UI refinements."

### Sprint 2 Priorities Debate
Discussion ensued about whether to prioritize:
1. Additional maze algorithms (Sidewinder, Aldous-Broder)
2. UI enhancements to the console interface

Chen advocated for UI improvements first: "Users will notice the interface before they appreciate algorithm differences."

Claude suggested: "We could split the work - I could implement algorithms while Chen refines the UI."

### Decision
Norrisa invoked executive privilege: "I want to finish porting the non-GUI code first. Let's complete all the maze generation algorithms before spending time on UI refinements."

## Action Items
1. Claude to implement Sidewinder algorithm next
2. Chen to document UI enhancement ideas for implementation after core algorithms are complete
3. Team to revisit UI improvements once all algorithms are functioning

## Next Meeting
TBD - After Sidewinder and Aldous-Broder algorithms are implemented

## Notes
The team reaffirmed commitment to completing a fully functional Python port before extensive UI work. Chen's UI suggestions will be incorporated in a future sprint.
