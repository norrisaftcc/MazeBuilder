# MazeBuilder Python Port - TODO List

## Sprint 1: Basic Console Implementation âœ…
- [x] Implement Cell class with bit flag directions
- [x] Implement Grid class with ASCII display
- [x] Implement Binary Tree maze generation algorithm
- [x] Add Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding
- [x] Create command-line interface with basic options
- [x] Add colored output
- [x] Implement distance markers display
- [x] Create test framework for all components

**Status: COMPLETE**  
The basic console implementation is now functional with the Binary Tree algorithm.
The application can generate mazes, display them with colored text, find the "longest path" 
solution, and show distances from the start point to each cell.
