    <h1>MazeBuilder Python Port - Team Collaboration</h1>
    <p>This document provides insight into our team's collaborative process while developing the Python port of the MazeBuilder application. It demonstrates our decision-making process, role delegation, and project planning approach.</p>

    <h2>Team Composition</h2>
    <div class="team-member">
        <h3>Norrisa (Project Lead/Product Owner)</h3>
        <p>Responsible for key decisions, project direction, and final approval of features. Maintains the vision of porting the original C# MazeBuilder to Python.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="team-member">
        <h3>Claude (Developer)</h3>
        <p>Primary developer responsible for implementing the maze generation algorithms, pathfinding, and core functionality. Focuses on code structure, performance, and testing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="team-member">
        <h3>Chen (UI/UX Specialist)</h3>
        <p>Specializes in user interface design and user experience. Advocates for intuitive, visually appealing interfaces and documentation. Ensures that the application is accessible and user-friendly.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Sprint 1 Development Process</h2>
    <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Initial Planning</h3>
            <p>The team reviewed the original C# MazeBuilder and C++ port to understand the core functionality needed for the Python version. We identified the essential components: Cell, Grid, maze generation algorithms, and pathfinding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Core Implementation</h3>
            <p>Claude implemented the foundational classes and the Binary Tree algorithm, setting up a test framework to ensure code quality. The initial implementation focused on functional correctness rather than UI polish.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>First Working Prototype</h3>
            <p>The team reviewed the first prototype that could generate simple mazes with the Binary Tree algorithm. Chen identified several UI improvements that could enhance user experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>Pathfinding Integration</h3>
            <p>Dijkstra's algorithm was implemented to find paths through the maze, including the "longest path" solution feature. This required careful consideration of data structures and algorithm efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3>UI Enhancements</h3>
            <p>Basic color and distance display features were added to improve the console interface, providing visual cues and additional information to users.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Sprint 1 Completion Meeting (May 9, 2024)</h2>
    <p>On May 9, 2024, the team met to review Sprint 1 progress and decide on priorities for Sprint 2. The meeting revealed differing perspectives on what to prioritize next:</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p><strong>Chen:</strong> "The console experience is our foundation. Polishing it now will improve user experience immediately and inform our Streamlit UI later. Users will notice the interface before they appreciate algorithm differences."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
        <p><strong>Claude:</strong> "Having all the maze algorithms ported would give us a complete functional implementation before focusing on UI refinements. We could split the work - I could implement algorithms while Chen refines the UI."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="decision">
        <h3>Key Decision Point</h3>
        <p>The team faced a prioritization decision: should we focus on implementing additional maze generation algorithms (Sidewinder, Aldous-Broder) or enhance the console UI first?</p>
        <p>Norrisa invoked executive privilege to resolve the prioritization question: <strong>"I want to finish porting the non-GUI code first. Let's complete all the maze generation algorithms before spending time on UI refinements."</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Post-Meeting Reflection</h3>
    <p>After the meeting, the team members shared their thoughts on the prioritization decision:</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p><strong>Claude:</strong> "I completely agree with your call. Finishing the core algorithms makes a lot of sense - it ensures we have a functionally complete port before focusing on UI refinements. The Binary Tree algorithm works well, but its northeast bias creates predictable mazes. Having Sidewinder and Aldous-Broder implemented will give users more variety and make the port much more valuable."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote">
        <p><strong>Chen:</strong> "While I'm passionate about user experience, I understand your prioritization. The current console UI is already functional, and users can generate mazes with colored paths and distances. Completing the core algorithms first gives us a solid foundation to build upon. I can use this time to design a comprehensive UI enhancement plan that we can implement in one cohesive effort rather than piecemeal changes."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="complete">Cell class with bit flag directions</li>
        <li class="complete">Grid class with ASCII display</li>

    <h2>Collaboration Insights</h2>
    <p>Our team's approach demonstrates several key software development practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear Role Definition:</strong> Each team member has defined responsibilities while still collaborating across areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> We made explicit decisions about what to prioritize, documenting the reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> We've broken the work into manageable sprints with clear goals and acceptance criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Constructive Disagreement:</strong> Team members felt comfortable advocating for different priorities, leading to a more thoughtful decision.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We're keeping records of decisions and progress to maintain alignment and provide learning opportunities.</li>
