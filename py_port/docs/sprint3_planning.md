# Sprint 3 Planning (June 2025)

## Overview

Sprint 3 will build on our successful implementation of the visualization layer in Sprint 2. We'll focus on performance improvements, advanced pathfinding, and 3D visualization options.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. A* Pathfinding in C++ Version

The A* (A-star) algorithm is a more efficient pathfinding algorithm that uses heuristics to prioritize paths that seem likely to lead to the goal. This will be implemented in the C++ version for comparison with Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Tasks:**
- Implement A* algorithm in C++ port
- Add distance heuristic functions
- Create performance comparison tests
- Update documentation

### 2. Performance Optimization

For larger mazes (50x50+), we'll implement optimizations to improve generation and pathfinding speed.

**Tasks:**
- Profile algorithm performance on large mazes
- Implement caching for repetitive operations
- Optimize memory usage for large grids
- Add parallel processing for suitable algorithms
- Create benchmarks for before/after comparison

### 3. Interactive Web UI Enhancements

Improve the Streamlit UI to allow for interactive maze exploration similar to what we implemented with the asciimatics renderer.

**Tasks:**
- Add user-controlled maze character
- Implement keyboard controls for navigation
- Add real-time solution feedback
- Create a "fog of war" mode where only explored areas are visible
- Update theme support for the Streamlit interface

### 4. 3D Visualization

Create a 3D renderer to visualize mazes in a more immersive way. This will likely use an external 3D engine like Panda3D, PyOpenGL, or Three.js (for web).

**Tasks:**
- Research and select a 3D visualization library
- Implement a basic 3D maze renderer
- Add first-person navigation perspective
- Create a "flyover" view option
- Support existing themes in 3D representation

### 5. Test Expansion

Improve test coverage for the entire codebase, especially for edge cases and complex scenarios.

**Tasks:**
- Create automated tests for the visualization layer
- Add tests for edge cases in pathfinding algorithms
- Implement performance tests for large mazes
- Add tests for the 3D renderer
- Create integration tests for the entire pipeline

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: A* pathfinding and performance optimization
- **Week 3-4**: Web UI enhancements and testing
- **Week 5-6**: 3D visualization implementation

## Success Criteria

- A* pathfinding is at least 20% faster than Dijkstra for large mazes
- 50x50 mazes can be generated and solved in under 1 second
- Interactive web UI allows for smooth navigation through the maze
- 3D visualization provides a compelling first-person perspective
- Test coverage exceeds 90% for all core components

## Resources Needed

- 3D graphics library (to be determined)
- Performance profiling tools
- Browser testing environment for web UI
- Benchmark dataset of varying maze sizes and complexities
