# MazeBuilder
2d Maze Projects

A C# port of "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck.

# Current Status
Cell and Grid initialization are complete.
Binary Tree, Sidewinder, and Aldous-Broder maze generation algorithms implemented.
Pathfinding with Dijkstra's algorithm added to C++ port.

# Sprint 2 Priorities (May 2025)
Based on our recent planning meeting, our priorities for this sprint are:
- Improve visualization in C# version
- Complete Python port
- Add more pathfinding algorithms to C++ version
- Performance optimization for large mazes

# To Do
- Maze ASCII display improvements
- Complete Python port structure
- Add A* pathfinding to C++ version
- Unit tests for all implementations
