# Understanding Dijkstra's Algorithm in Our Maze

This guide explains how Dijkstra's algorithm works and how we've implemented it in our maze builder application.

## What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem. In simpler terms, it finds the shortest path from a starting point to every other point in a graph.

Developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956, it's one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science and has applications in:

- Navigation systems
- Network routing protocols
- Flight scheduling
- Robotics pathfinding
- Game development
- And of course, maze solving!

## How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works

The algorithm works through the following steps:

1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node (cell): infinity for all nodes except the starting node, which gets a value of 0.
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited and create a set of all unvisited nodes.
3. For the current node (starting with the start node), consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances.
4. When we've considered all neighbors of the current node, mark it as visited.
5. If the destination node has been marked visited, or if the smallest tentative distance among unvisited nodes is infinity (indicating no path exists), then stop.
6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new "current node" and repeat from step 3.

## Our Implementation

Our implementation consists of two main classes:

### 1. The `Distances` Class

This class is responsible for:
- Tracking the distance of each cell from the starting point
- Providing methods to set and retrieve distance values
- Finding the cell with the maximum distance (farthest from start)

The `Distances` class uses a hash map to store cell distances, with cell coordinates as keys. This provides efficient lookup and storage.

### 2. The `Dijkstra` Class

This class implements the algorithm with three main functions:

1. `calculateDistances` - Applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find distances from a start cell to all other cells
2. `shortestPath` - Finds the shortest path between two specific cells
3. `longestPath` - Finds the "solution" to the maze (the longest shortest path)

## Finding the Maze Solution

One interesting application of Dijkstra's algorithm is finding the "solution" to a maze. This is the longest shortest path through the maze, and we find it through a two-step process:

1. Starting from any cell (we use the top-left corner), find the cell that's farthest away (let's call it cell A)
2. From cell A, find the cell that's farthest from it (cell B)
3. The path from A to B is the longest shortest path through the maze - the "solution"

This approach works because:
- A perfect maze has exactly one path between any two cells
- The longest path will be between the two most distant cells
- Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees we find the shortest path between those cells

## Priority Queue Optimization

A key optimization in our implementation is using a priority queue (min-heap) to always process the closest unvisited node next. This significantly improves performance compared to a naive approach of scanning all nodes each time.

In C++, we use:
```cpp
std::priority_queue<
    std::pair<int, std::string>,
    std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>>,
    std::greater<std::pair<int, std::string>>
> frontier;
```

This ensures we always expand the most promising nodes first, which is the essence of Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Visualizing the Solution

We've added a special display function that shows the solution path through the maze using 'X' characters. This helps students see the algorithm's result and understand how the solution navigates through the maze.

The `displayWithPath` function takes the grid and a vector of cells representing the path, then renders the maze with the path highlighted.

## Educational Value

Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm provides several educational benefits:

1. **Graph Theory Concepts**: Understanding nodes, edges, and graph traversal
2. **Data Structures**: Using priority queues, maps, and vectors effectively
3. **Algorithm Analysis**: Seeing how a greedy algorithm makes optimal local choices
4. **Space-Time Tradeoffs**: Balancing memory usage against computational speed
5. **Optimization Techniques**: Using appropriate data structures to improve performance

## Further Challenges

Once students understand the basic implementation, here are some challenges they might explore:

1. Implement other pathfinding algorithms (A*, Breadth-First Search) and compare them
2. Add weights to paths (making some passages "harder" to traverse)
3. Create a visualization that shows the algorithm's progress step by step
4. Implement a real-time solver that can navigate through the maze
5. Add multiple targets that must be visited in the most efficient order (TSP problem)

Understanding Dijkstra's algorithm provides a foundation for these more advanced explorations in algorithm design and optimization.
